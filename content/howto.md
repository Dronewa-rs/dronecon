## How do I make my own [one of these](https://github.com/Dronewa-rs/dronecon/)
\

That's easy.  Use [this template from Github](https://github.com/new?template_name=dronecon&template_owner=Dronewa-rs), or use the [original](https://github.com/lopes/zola.386).

If you know what you're doing with Git, you can [Fork](https://github.com/Dronewa-rs/dronecon/fork) the repo or just [clone](https://github.com/Dronewa-rs/dronecon/) it.

Built with: [Zola](https://getzola.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [JS](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Other tools
\

• [Github](https://docs.github.com/).
\

• [other Github getting-started tips](https://github.com/trustdan/rust-class/tree/main/1-getting-started) (not 100%).
\

• [Vim](https://www.vim.org/about.php).
\

• Random ASCII art websites like [this one](https://ascii-generator.site/).
\

• You can screencap an image (Win + Shift + "S" in Windows) and upload it to the site, then mess with the settings.  I always went with their option 2.
\

• Or you can enter some text with the font you like in Word and do the same to get the ASCII text image.
\

• Some Large Language Models [(LLMs)](https://github.com/trustdan/awesome-customizable-LLMs/).
\

• [Typora](https://theme.typora.io/), good for quickly editing markdown files like those found in GitHub READMEs.
\

• The [Poster](https://dronewa.rs/poster) and [OnePager](https://dronewa.rs/onepager) were built with [LaTeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/).
